'''
__init__.py is a special Python file that indicates to the interpreter that the directory should be treated as a package.
This file can be empty, or it can contain valid Python code. It is executed when the package is imported.
The __init__.py file can also be used to define the public interface of the package by specifying which modules should be 
imported when the package is imported.    

This is a must have file for any directory that you want to be treated as a package.
It can also be used to execute package initialization code.
